# Probelm Description

- In the Bin Packing Problem (BPP), given a collection of items, the goal is to efficiently pack the items into the minimum number of bins, where each item has an associated weight, and the bins have a maximum weight. The problem can be found in different industries. For example, the supply chain management industry requires loading multiple packages onto a truck, plane, or vessel.

# Comparison and Analysis of QAOA, Quantum Annealing, Quantum Variational Approaches, and Brute Force

## Disclaimer:

> **Note**: okay look QAOA_QUBO and Variational_QUBO don't actually work because of I couldn't figure out why some function don't work the way they used to.

## 1. **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)**

- **Type**: Hybrid Quantum-Classical
- **Ansatz**: Predefined with alternating cost and mixing Hamiltonians
- **Strengths**:
  - Scalable to larger problems
  - Flexible with tunable parameters (`p` layers)
  - Approximates solutions in polynomial time for complex problems
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Approximate solution only (may require high `p` for accuracy)
  - Depends on classical optimizer efficiency
- **Compared to Brute Force**:
  - Provides a much faster solution, especially for large instances, but the solution is approximate.

## 2. **Quantum Annealing**

- **Type**: Adiabatic Quantum Process
- **Ansatz**: No explicit variational Ansatz (energy evolves under a Hamiltonian)
- **Strengths**:
  - No parameter tuning required
  - Can efficiently handle certain optimization problems (e.g., QUBO)
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Can get stuck in local minima (non-optimal solutions)
  - Requires specific hardware (e.g., D-Wave)
- **Compared to Brute Force**:
  - More efficient for large-scale problems but does not always guarantee optimality.

## 3. **Quantum Variational Approaches (with Different Ansatz)**

- **Type**: Hybrid Quantum-Classical
- **Ansatz**: Flexible and customizable based on the problem
- **Strengths**:
  - Can be tailored to specific problems using custom Ansatz designs
  - General framework adaptable to a wide range of quantum systems
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Performance depends heavily on Ansatz selection and optimizer
  - Difficult to find optimal parameters in certain cases
- **Compared to Brute Force**:
  - Offers flexibility and scalability but only provides approximate solutions, unlike brute force.

## 4. **Brute Force Approach**

- **Type**: Classical Exact
- **Ansatz**: Not applicable (Exhaustive search)
- **Strengths**:
  - Guarantees finding the exact optimal solution
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Exponential time complexity (`O(2^n)`), impractical for large problem sizes
- **Compared to Quantum Methods**:
  - Provides an exact solution but is computationally prohibitive for large problems, unlike quantum methods that provide scalable and approximate solutions.
